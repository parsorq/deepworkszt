# Push to main

After making code changes in this project:

1. Stage the changed files (e.g. `git add` the files you edited).
2. Commit with a clear, short message describing the change.
3. Push to `main`: `git push origin main`.

Do not ask for confirmation before pushing; the user has requested that changes are always pushed to main.

Only commit files that are part of the change (do not add unrelated untracked files like `.cursor/` or assets unless the user asked for them).
